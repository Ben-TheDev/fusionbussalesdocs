** Breakdown System |
** The breakdown system is one of the most loved things in the ROBLOX bus community and something we wish every bus had.  Most of the systems we have today are not the best and only bring very little to nothing.  Introducing the VAR Breakdown systems.  With the most “Scenarios”  on the platform and highly advanced coding systems, it is very easy to use.  It's ** a button to turn on and off on buses and will come with every bus.  Here is what we currently have for “Scenarios”
- A tire explosion simulation
- An engine explosion
- A transmission explosion
- A radiator explosion
- Bad battery
- Bad alternator.
- More to be added in the next versions.

** Once we have the busses done,  we will release updates and bug fixes to the VAR Breakdown system.  It will be easy to update. Easy enough that all you have to do is get rid of the old Breakdown system under plugins in the A-Chassis tune folder, And put the new one in.



** Air Pressure |
** The air pressure system is pretty easy to understand.  The Air Pressure system brings the feature of realism.  The way it works is when you first spawn your bus it will not have any air for the brakes.  So when you start up your bus it will loop and beep at you like real life telling you low air levels are detected and you have to wait for the pressure to ** build before driving.  And it won't let you drive if you don't.  When you are driving the bus you will be able to see the compressor exhaust the extra air it contains like in real life when you see the air pop out under the bus sometimes.  If you abuse the brakes at high speeds or let the bus sit for a long time chances are you will be low on air.  You can ** also see if you are low on the air pressure gauge on the A-chassis UI.



** Chassis sounds |
** You will hear random sounds from the chassis at any time when driving.  For example, transmission sounds when you shift,  When you are on a bumpy road you might hear some sound from the suspension. And much more.



** Number systems |
** The number system is another easy thing to get the hang of.  All you do is go into the Driver seats under the bus files, and there will be “Bus Number Value”  and “License Plate Number Value”  These will control what your license plate and Bus numbers say.  To change them just click on each value and input a number inside the value.



** Realistic Systems |
** The Realistic Suspension system is when you are turning or going over bumpy platforms the suspension will act similar to real life,  it will bounce the bus around and shake the bus body according to how it would in real life.  And will provide realistic steering to the bus.  Every bus is tuned to perfection so we can give you the most realistic bus on the ** ROBLOX platform.
** Working Emergency Exits |
** The working emergency exits can be found on the roof of the bus and the back of the bus,  They all work, unlike some other busses on ROBLOX.  They work on the rear of the bus and will work on the top of the bus to if the bus supports it on the roof.



** AC sounds and Music |
** The AC sounds can be turned on by pressing the AC button on your bus dashboard,  and it will play an AC sound on your bus from the location of your AC.  For the music, you can click the radio on your bus to put on a radio station for the kids in the back of your bus to listen on the ride to school!



** Seat Belt |
** The seatbelt is located on the side of your driver's seat on the bus.  Before you start driving you must click the seatbelt or the bus will continue to beep at you and display a warning on the dashboard of no seatbelt detected.



** Fuel systems |
** The fuel system is a system on your bus that can replicate real-life fuel systems.  You can run out of fuel or fill up fuel,  And your bus will warn you when you are running low. 



** High idle |
** The high idle system is a system where you can make your bus rev to the right setting, so when you idle it will make your RPM go up the rpm you need.  This can be useful for filling your bus up with air.



** Exhaust effect |
** When you start up your bus you will be able to see the bus exhaust go out of the exhaust pipe.  And if you break down or you burn oil you will see your exhaust smoke turn black!



** Pedals |
** Your bus will come with pedals that can be seen moving.  If you press the brake, you will see the brake pedal go down.  If you press the gas your gas will go down.
